# My Python Projects

Welcome to my Python projects portfolio! Here, you’ll find a collection of beginner-friendly and practical projects I’ve worked on as part of my learning journey.

## Featured Projects

- **Beginner Games**  
  A set of simple Python games by [Mosh Hamedani’s YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh). Great for practicing programming fundamentals and logic.

- **Password Manager**  
  A project developed as part of my **Certificate III in IT (Cyber pathway)** course. Implements file handling, encryption/decryption, and menu-driven functionality.

- **Port Scanner**  
  Another project from my **Certificate III in IT (Cyber pathway)** course. A Python tool to scan open ports on a network, helping me understand basic networking and cybersecurity concepts.

## Learning & Inspiration

- I’ve been learning Python through practical projects and tutorials, including **Mosh Hamedani’s YouTube channel**, which helped me build the beginner games.
- The **Certificate III in IT (Cyber pathway)** course provided structured guidance for more advanced projects like the password manager and port scanner.
